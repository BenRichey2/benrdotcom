    A repository to store most of the code that will be running my personal website.
I am currently enrolled in a web programming class where I'm learning about front end
web design using html, javascript, jQuery, php, etc. I am having a lot of fun doing
this, and I would like to continue learning about web interfaces through creating
a website. I intend to design both the front and back end of the website in this
repository. It will serve as a place to showcase my code.

    My goals for this website are to create a clean looking personal website that
can be used as a resume, and just for fun.
